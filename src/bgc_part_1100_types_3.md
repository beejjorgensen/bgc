# Types III: Conversions

In this chapter, we want to talk all about converting from one type to
another. C has a variety of ways of doing this, and some might be a
little different that you're used to in other languages.

Before we talk about how to make conversions happen, let's talk about
how they work when they _do_ happen.

## String Conversions

Unlike many languages, C doesn't do string-to-number (and vice-versa)
conversions in quite as streamlined a manner as it does numeric
conversions.

For these, we'll have to call functions to do the dirty work.

### Numeric Value to String

When we want to convert a number to a string, we can use either
`sprintf()` (pronounced _SPRINT-f_) or `snprintf()`
(_s-n-print-f_)^[They're the same except `snprintf()` allows you to
specify a maximum number of bytes to output, preventing the overrunning
of the end of your string. So it's safer.]

These basically work like `printf()`, except they output to a string
instead, and you can print that string later, or whatever.

For example, turning part of the value ฯ into a string:

``` {.c .numberLines}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char s[10];
    float f = 3.14159;

    // Convert "f" to string, storing in "s", writing at most 10 characters
    // including the NUL terminator

    snprintf(s, 10, "%f", f);

    printf("String value: %s\n", s);  // String value: 3.141590
}
```

If we wanted to convert a `double`, we'd use `%lf`. Or a `long double`,
`%Lf`.

### String to Numeric Value

There are a couple families of functions to do this in C. We'll call
these the `atoi` (pronounced _a-to-i_) family and the `strtol`
(_stir-to-long_) family.

For basic conversion from a string to a number, try the `atoi` functions
from `<stdlib.h>`. These have bad error-handling characteristics
(including undefined behavior if you pass in a bad string), so use them
carefully.

|Function|Description|
|:-|:-|
|`atoi`|String to `int`|
|`atof`|String to `float`|
|`atol`|String to `long int`|
|`atoll`|String to `long long int`|

Though the spec doesn't cop to it, the `a` at the beginning of the
function stands for [flw[ASCII|ASCII]], so really `atoi()` is
"ASCII-to-integer", but saying so today is a bit ASCII-centric.

Here's an example converting a string to a `float`:

``` {.c .numberLines}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *pi = "3.14159";
    float f;

    f = atof(pi);

    printf("%f\n", f);
}
```

But, like I said, we get undefined behavior from weird things like this:

``` {.c}
int x = atoi("what");  // "What" ain't no number I ever heard of
```

(When I run that, I get `0` back, but you really shouldn't count on that
in any way. You could get something completely different.)

For better error handling characteristics, let's check out all those
`strtol` functions, also in `<stdlib.h>`. Not only that, but they
convert to more types and more bases, too!

|Function|Description|
|:-|:-|
|`strtol`|String to `long int`|
|`strtoll`|String to `long long int`|
|`strtoul`|String to `unsigned long int`|
|`strtoull`|String to `unsigned long long int`|
|`strtof`|String to `float`|
|`strtod`|String to `double`|
|`strtold`|String to `long double`|

These functions all follow a similar pattern of use, and are a lot of
people's first experience with pointers to pointers! But never
fret---it's easier than it looks.

Let's do an example where we convert a string to an `unsigned long`,
discarding error information (i.e. information about bad characters in
the input string):

``` {.c .numberLines}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "3490";

    // Convert string s, a number in base 10, to an unsigned long int.
    // NULL means we don't care to learn about any error information.

    unsigned long int x = strtoul(s, NULL, 10);

    printf("%lu\n", x);  // 3490
}
```

Notice a couple things there. Even though we didn't deign to capture any
information about error characters in the string, `strtoul()` won't give
us undefined behavior; it will just return `0`.

Also, we specified that this was a decimal (base 10) number.

Does this mean we can convert numbers of different bases? Sure! Let's do
binary!

``` {.c .numberLines}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "101010";  // What's the meaning of this number?

    // Convert string s, a number in base 2, to an unsigned long int.

    unsigned long int x = strtoul(s, NULL, 2);

    printf("%lu\n", x);  // 42
}
```

OK, that's all fun and games, but what's with that `NULL` in there?
What's that for?

That helps us figure out if an error occurred in the processing of the
string. It's a pointer to a pointer to a `char`, which sounds scary, but
isn't once you wrap your head around it.

Let's do an example where we feed in a deliberately bad number, and
we'll see how `strtol()` lets us know where the first invalid digit is.

``` {.c .numberLines}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "34x90";  // "x" is not a valid digit in base 10!
    char *badchar;

    // Convert string s, a number in base 10, to an unsigned long int.

    unsigned long int x = strtoul(s, &badchar, 10);

    // It tries to convert as much as possible, so gets this far:

    printf("%lu\n", x);  // 34

    // But we can see the offending bad character because badchar
    // points to it!

    printf("Invalid character: %c\n", *badchar);  // "x"
}
```

So there we have `strtoul()` modifying what `badchar` points to in order
to show us where things went wrong^[We have to pass a pointer to
`badchar` to `strtoul()` or it won't be able to modify it in any way
we can see, analogous to why you have to pass a pointer to an `int` to a
function if you want that function to be able to change that value of
that `int`.].

But what if nothing goes wrong? In that case, `badchar` will point to
the `NUL` terminator at the end of the string. So we can test for it:

``` {.c .numberLines}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "3490";  // "x" is not a valid digit in base 10!
    char *badchar;

    // Convert string s, a number in base 10, to an unsigned long int.

    unsigned long int x = strtoul(s, &badchar, 10);

    // Check if things went well

    if (*badchar == '\0') {
        printf("Success! %lu\n", x);
    } else  {
        printf("Partial conversion: %lu\n", x);
        printf("Invalid character: %c\n", *badchar);
    }
}
```

So there you have it. The `atoi()`-style functions are good in a
controlled pinch, but the `strtol()`-style functions give you far more
control over error handling and the base of the input.

## Numeric Conversions

### Boolean

If you convert a zero to `bool`, the result is `0`. Otherwise it's `1`.

### Integer to Integer Conversions

If an integer type is converted to unsigned and doesn't fit in it, the
unsigned result wraps around odometer-style until it fits in the
unsigned^[In practice, what's probably happening on your implementation
is that the high-order bits are just being dropped from the result, so a
16-bit number `0x1234` being converted to an 8-bit number ends up as
`0x0034`, or just `0x34`.].

If an integer type is converted to a signed number and doesn't fit, the
result is implementation-defined! Something documented will happen, but
you'll have to look it up^[Again, in practice, what will likely happen
on your system is that the bit pattern for the original will be
truncated and then just used to represent the signed number, two's
complement. For example, my system takes an `unsigned char` of `192` and
converts it to `signed char` `-64`. In two's complement, the bit pattern
for both these numbers is binary `11000000`.]

### Integer and Floating Point Conversions

If a floating point type is converted to an integer type, the fractional
part is discarded with prejudice^[Not really---it's just discarded
regularly.].

But---and here's the catch---if the number is too large to fit in the
integer, you get undefined behavior. So don't do that.

Going From integer or floating point to floating point, C makes a best
effort to find the closest floating point number to the integer that it
can.

Again, though, if the original value can't be represented, it's undefined
behavior.

## Implicit Conversions

These are conversions the compiler does automatically for you when you
mix and match types.

### The Integer Promotions {#integer-promotions}

In a number of places, if an `int` can be used to represent a value from
`char` or `short` (signed or unsigned), that value is _promoted_ up to
`int`. If it doesn't fit in an `int`, it's promoted to `unsigned int`.

This is how we can do something like this:

``` {.c}
char x = 10, y = 20;
int i = x + y;
```

In that case, `x` and `y` get promoted to `int` by C before the math
takes place.

The integer promotions take place during The Usual Arithmetic
Conversions, with variadic functions^[Functions with a variable number
of arguments.], unary `+` and `-` operators, or when passing values to
functions without prototypes^[This is rarely done because the compiler
will complain and having a prototype is the _Right Thing_ to do. I think
this still works for historic reasons, before prototypes were a thing.].

### The Usual Arithmetic Conversions {#usual-arithmetic-conversions}

These are automatic conversions that C does around numeric operations
that you ask for. (That's actually what they're called, by the way, by
C11 ยง6.3.1.8.) Note that for this section, we're just talking about
numeric types---strings will come later.

These conversions answer questions about what happens when you mix
types, like this:

``` {.c}
int x = 3 + 1.2;   // Mixing int and double
                   // 4.2 is converted to int
                   // 4 is stored in x

float y = 12 * 2;  // Mixing float and int
                   // 24 is converted to float
                   // 24.0 is stored in y
```

Do they become `int`s? Do they become `float`s? How does it work?

Here are the steps, paraphrased for easy consumption.

1. If one thing in the expression is a floating type, convert the other
   things to that floating type.

2. Otherwise, if both types are integer types, perform the integer
   promotions on each, then make the operand types as big as they need
   to be hold the common largest value. Sometimes this involves changing
   signed to unsigned.

If you want to know the gritty details, check out C11 ยง6.3.1.8. But you
probably don't.

Just generally remember that int types become float types if there's a
floating point type anywhere in there, and the compiler makes an effort
to make sure mixed integer types don't overflow.

Finally, if you convert from one floating point type to another, the
compiler will try to make an exact conversion. If it can't, it'll do the
best approximation it can. If the number is too large to fit in the type
you're converting into, _boom_: undefined behavior!

### `void*`

The `void*` type is interesting because it can be converted from or to
any pointer type.

``` {.c}
int x = 10;

void *p = &x;  // &x is type int*, but we store it in a void*

int *q = p;    // p is void*, but we store it in an int*
```

## Explicit Conversions

These are conversions from type to type that you have to ask for; the
compiler won't do it for you.

You can convert from one type to another by assigning one type to
another with an `=`.

You can also convert explicitly with a _cast_.

### Casting

You can explicitly change the type of an expression by putting a new
type in parentheses in front of it. Some C devs frown on the practice
unless absolutely necessary, but it's likely you'll come across some C
code with these in it.

Let's do an example where we want to convert an `int` into a `long` so
that we can store it in a `long`.

Note: this example is contrived and the cast in this case is completely
unnecessary because the `x + 12` expression would automatically be
changed to `long int` to match the wider type of `y`.

``` {.c}
int x = 10;
long int y = (long int)x + 12;
```

In that example, even those `x` was type `int` before, the expression
`(long int)x` has type `long int`. We say, "We cast `x` to `long int`."

More commonly, you might see a cast being used to convert a `void*`
into a specific pointer type so it can be dereferenced.

A callback from the built-in `qsort()` function might display this
behavior since it has `void*`s passed into it:

``` {.c}
int compar(const void *elem1, const void *elem2)
{
    return *((const int*)elem2) - *((const int*)elem1);
}
```

But you could also clearly write it with an assignment:

``` {.c}
int compar(const void *elem1, const void *elem2)
{
    const int *e1 = elem1;
    const int *e2 = elem2;

    return *e2 - *e1;
}
```

One place you'll see casts more commonly is to avoid a warning when
printing pointer values with the rarely-used `%p` which gets picky with
anything other than a `void*`:

``` {.c}
int x = 3490;
int *p = &x;

printf("%p\n", p);
```

generates this warning:

``` {.default}
warning: format โ%pโ expects argument of type โvoid *โ, but argument
         2 has type โint *โ
```

You can fix it with a cast:

``` {.c}
printf("%p\n", (void *)p);
```

Another place is with explicit pointer changes, if you don't want to use
an intervening `void*`, but these are also pretty uncommon:

``` {.c}
long x = 3490;
long *p = &x;
unsigned char *c = (unsigned char *)p;
```

Again, casting is rarely _needed_ in practice. If you find yourself
casting, there might be another way to do the same thing, or maybe
you're casting unnecessarily.

Or maybe it is necessary. Personally, I try to avoid it, but am not
afraid to use it if I have to.
